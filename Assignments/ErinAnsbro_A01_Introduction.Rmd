2.  Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3.  Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4.  Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5.  When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
6.  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the appropriate assigment section on Sakai.


## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex
Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.
```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory
This setting will help deal with relative paths later on...
 - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options`
 - Select the RMarkdown section
 - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project" (If you don't see this option, try restarting RStudio.)


## 2) Discussion Questions
Enter answers to the questions just below the >Answer: prompt.

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I was a data researcher for a year after undergradute, I mainly cleaned data in excel and used SQL to create databases. I have no experience with R and a very small amount of experience with Git.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: No.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I feel apprehensive about being able to follow written directions, I do a lot better with visual directions. For example, I do not know where the stage and commit buttons are at first look. Once I figured that out, I went ahead and pressed stage then commit and then push, and now I don't see the A01 rmd in the Git tab and don't know how to stage and commit again, or even if I'm supposed to do that multiple times.


## 3) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file, committed those changes, and pushed them to your GitHub account.
